Can you remember when you first learned to draw a star? I can! I was first taught to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{bartTri.pdf}
\]
But I wanted to know how to draw 5-pointed stars like the other
kids. So one day I taught myself to draw a star like this:
\[
\includegraphics{bartTri2.pdf}
\]
This may seem like a silly way to draw this star---it certainly makes
me chuckle now. Let's see if we can give a theory for drawing stars
that will connect the two different stars above, teach you how to
draw some new stars, and learn a little more mathematics along the
way.


We'll start with $5$ points equally spaced on a circle:
\[
\includegraphics{stfive.pdf}
\]
Think of these points as \textit{pins}.  Next we'll start at the top
and draw lines that we'll think of as \textit{strings}, moving
clockwise to the point two steps away each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stfive1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive3.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stfive5.pdf}
\]
Check it out, we got a star! If we had used pins and string to make
this star, we could have done it with one piece of string.



Now start with $6$ points equally spaced on a circle. Again, we'll
move clockwise two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stsix1.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix2.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix3.pdf}
\]
Oops, we've run out of points! No worries, just start again at one of
the points that hasn't been touched by a line yet, drawing lines and
moving two steps each time:
\[
\includegraphics{stsix4.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix5.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix6.pdf}
\]
Ah! The other star! In this case, if we used pins and strings, we'd
need to use \textit{two} pieces of string.


I'm hoping that the following notation will help out:
\[
\stringstar{n}{s}=\left[\begin{minipage}{3.7in}
the star with $n$ equally spaced points where we move $s$ steps clockwise
\end{minipage}\right]
\]
Remember, $\stringstar{n}{s}$ is a star, \textbf{not} a fraction!

With this notation, the five pointed star above would be called $\stringstar{5}{2}$, while the Star of David would be called $\stringstar{6}{2}$.

\begin{question}%% GOOD _- EXPLAINS WHY CIRCLE OF FIFTHS IS CIRCLE OF FOURTHS
  Some stars with different numbers look the same. For example:
  \[
  \stringstar{12}{3}\quad\text{and}\quad\stringstar{12}{9}
  \]
look the same.

    same.

  \item \textbf{Explain why} your rule is true.

\begin{question}
You might have noticed that some stars can be drawn in a single stroke, as the common five pointed star $\stringstar{5}{2}$, whereas others are made of two or more pieces, like the Star of David $\stringstar{6}{2}$.
\[
\includegraphics{stfive5.pdf}\qquad\includegraphics{stsix6.pdf}
\]
\begin{center}
    Single stroke \qquad Two pieces
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Look at the stars you drew above. Find examples of stars drawn in a \textbf{single stroke}. Write their names using the notation $\stringstar{n}{s}$.
\answerspace
\item Give some examples of stars made of \textbf{two or more pieces}.
\answerspace
\item Look for patterns. Give a rule for when a star can be drawn in a single stroke.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Before, we only looked at stars where the step we is smaller than the total number of points. In other words, stars $\stringstar{n}{s}$ where the number on the bottom is less than the number on the top, $s<n$. Let's look at what happens if we use $s>n$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw the star $\stringstar{5}{6}$.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
  \pic {circledots={5}};
  \node at (0,0) {$\stringstar{5}{6}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\item Draw the star $\stringstar{8}{12}$.
\begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
  \pic {circledots={8}};
  \node at (0,0) {$\stringstar{8}{12}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
  \item \textbf{Give a general rule} comparing stars where the number on the bottom is \textbf{bigger} than the number on top with stars in which the number on the bottom is \textbf{smaller} than the number on top.
  
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}

%Consider a star $\stringstar{n}{s}$ where $s> n$. Find a star $\stringstar{n}{t}$ that is identical to $\stringstar{n}{s}$ where $t<n$. Explain your reasoning.



\begin{freeResponse}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A star $\stringstar{n}{s}$ looks the same as $\stringstar{n}{t}$ for
    $0 < s < t< n$ when $n=s+ t$.
  \item This is true, because you are just drawing the star ``backwards.''
  \item If $s$ and $t$ can be bigger than $n$, then we modify the
    rule to be: A star $\stringstar{n}{s}$ looks the same as
    $\stringstar{n}{t}$ for $0 < s < t< n$ when $n$ is a factor of
    $s+t$. In essence, we just spin around the circle more times
    before we put our point down.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{freeResponse}





\begin{question}
  Describe what happens when we ``reduce to
    lowest terms'' (as you would do with a fraction!). As an example, think about how the stars
    $\stringstar{6}{2}$ and $\stringstar{3}{1}$ are related.  \textbf{Explain why} your description holds.
  \begin{instructorNotes}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item When we ``reduce'' a star, we find the piece it is made
        of.  The star
        \[
        \stringstar{12}{4}
        \]
        is made of pieces of $\stringstar{3}{1}$, and the fraction
        \[
        \frac{12}{4} = \frac{3}{1}.
        \]
      \item This happens, because of how stars work, and how fractions reduce.
        \[
        \frac{x\cdot p}{y\cdot p} =  \frac{x}{y}.
        \]
        This is how fractions reduce. On the other hand, with stars,
        if $n=x\cdot p$, and $s=y\cdot p$, then we must have a
        $\stringstar{x}{y}$ star as part of the star
        $\stringstar{x\cdot p}{y\cdot q}$, as we are traveling from a
        point on the circle to a point that is
        \[
        \frac{x\cdot p}{y\cdot q} =  \frac{x}{y}
        \]
        further clockwise on the circle.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{instructorNotes}
