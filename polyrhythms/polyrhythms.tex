One instrument playing by itself, solo, can be beautiful. However, when more than one instrument play together, with separate pitch and rhythm, the whole seems greater than the sum of its parts, and what is produced is wondrous.

To understand the combined effect of several instruments at a time, we will start in the simplest possible setting. Suppose we have two simple drum beats played at the same time:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {\mbox{
\instrumentnumber{1}           % number of instruments
\setstaffs1{2}                 % lines per instrument
\generalmeter{\meterfrac{3}{4}}% time stamp. 
\generalsignature{0}          % sets the key. a number greater than 0 is sharp, smaller than 0 is flat
\setclefsymbol1\drumclef
\startextract
% bar 1
  \NOtes\qu h \qu h \qu h   
  \nextstaff
  \qup h \qsk \qup h\en
\setrightrepeat
\endextract}};
\node at (-2,2) {Two beats};
\node at (-4,0) {Against};
\node at (-2,-2) {Three beats};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Try with your friends to produce these drum beats, with one friend clapping two-claps every second, and second friend clapping three-claps every two seconds. This can be difficult, please don't get discouraged.


A (complex) rhythm created by two rhythms played simultaneously is called a 
\textbf{polyrhythm}. The simplest polyrhythms, like the one above, are when you play $X$ beats against $N$ beats (above we played $2$ against $3$ beats, so $X=2$ and $N=3$). We're going to try to understand how to think about, and play, $(X:N)$-polyrhythms. There are two question we want to answer:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How does one interpret, or decode, a basic $(X:N)$-polyrhythm written in music?
\item How does one create and express a $(X:N)$-polyrhythm for arbitrary values of $X$ and $N$?
\end{enumerate}
These questions are similar but subtly different. In the following pages you will find two algorithms for solving these questions.

\textbf{Algorithm for interpreting an ``\textit{X} against \textit{N}'' polyrhythm.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the bottom line of music.

Let's demonstrate by finding our $(2:3)$-polyrhythm above.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the bottom line of music:

\item Divide each beat by $X=2$:

\item Mark the first note, and then every $2$nd note after that:

\setstaffs1{1}                 % lines per instrument

\item Additionally mark the first note, and then every $3$rd ($N=3$) note after that:

\begin{music}
\instrumentnumber{1}           % number of instruments
\setstaffs1{1}                 % lines per instrument

\item Extend duration of marked notes over unmarked notes:

\begin{question}
Actually playing polyrhythms can be challenging! One technique used by musicians is to use a mnemonic phrase to help. The website below:
\begin{center}
\url{https://mymusiceducation.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/phrases-for-grouplets-polyrhythm/}
\end{center}
suggests that to play a  $(2:3)$-polyrhythm, you can use the phrase ``NOT DIFFICULT.'' We demonstrate the connection below.


\begin{music}
\instrumentnumber{1}           % number of instruments
\setstaffs1{1}                 % lines per instrument
\generalmeter{\meterfrac{3}{4}}% time stamp. 
\generalsignature{0}          % sets the key. a number greater than 0 is sharp, smaller than 0 is flat

Let's demonstrate by creating our $(2:3)$-polyrhythm above in \timesig{6}{4} time.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write $2\times 3=6$ quarter notes on a line:


\begin{music}

At this point the composer or artist should convert into the required time signature. 


\begin{question}
If we are given two beats, we can find the polyrhythm pretty easily. However, if someone just asks for a ``four against six'' polyrhythm (as we did above) without any context, then you have to decide which time signature to use.  The time signature you pick will determine which notes you use. Remember: 
\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
  \node at (0,0) {\meterfrac{\raisebox{.2em}{M}}{W}};
  \node[anchor=west] at (1,1) {number of beats in a measure};
  \node[anchor=west] at (1,-1) {number of beats in a whole note};
  \draw[->] (1,.9) -- (.4,.4);
  \draw[->] (1,-.9) -- (.4,-.4);
