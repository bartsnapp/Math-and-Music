\title{Polyrhythms}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  We introduce polyrhythms.  Which are "poly," meaning "many," rhythms.  So polyrhythms are when we play many rhythms at once.
\end{abstract}

One instrument playing by itself, solo, can be beautiful. However, when more than one instrument play together, with separate pitch and rhythm, the whole seems greater than the sum of its parts, and what is produced is wondrous.

To understand the combined effect of several instruments at a time, we will start in the simplest possible setting: clapping. 

Imagine this: Bart and Danny clap together, but, to make it more fun, Bart is clapping a two-beat rhythm, while Danny is clapping a three-beat rhythm. This means that in the same time, let's say 2 seconds, Bart claps two times, while Danny claps three.

\textbf{If they start clapping at the same time, how many claps after will they clap at the same time again?}

Let's try to do this as a class. This is harder than it seems, since you have to maintain your own rhythm ignoring the other rhythm that is happening at the same time.

A (complex) rhythm created by two rhythms played simultaneously is called a 
\textbf{polyrhythm}. The simplest polyrhythms, like the one above, are when you play $X$ beats against $N$ beats (above we played $3$ against $2$ beats, so $X=3$ and $N=2$). We use the notation $(X:N)$.


\begin{question}
As you saw before, playing two rhythms at the same time can be confusing. Musicians, however, are very clever, so one thing they might do is try to think of a polyrhythm as a single thing. To understand this idea better, let's encode the $(3:2)$ polyrhythm in the drum machine. This is easier: you just have to encode the 3-beat pattern in one drum and the 2-beat pattern in another drum.

It might look like this:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{polyrhythms/poly3-2.png}
\end{center}

Notice that what we are trying to do is break the time evenly so that we play 3 (on the hi-foot) or 2 (on the tom-tom) equally spaced beats.

Once you know how it sounds, it is easier to reproduce it, thinking of a single, more complex, rhythm rather than two, simpler, rhythms at the same time. In fact, you could write this in a single line/drum.

Now you try!

\textbf{IMPORTANT!!!!} Don't clear your polyrhythms. Open a new tab for each polyrhythm. You will need them throughout this packet.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Encode a $(3:4)$ polyrhythm. Use a $\timesig{3}{4}$ time signature.

\begin{question}
The drum machine is a little limited because it only allows a given number of beats. Let's now try a few other polyrhythms using the online sequencer.

As an example, this is one way of encoding the $(3:2)$ polyrhythm:

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{polyrhythms/poly3-2seq.png}
\end{center}

\textbf{IMPORTANT!!!!} Don't clear your polyrhythms. Open a new tab for each polyrhythm. You will need them throughout this packet.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the online sequencer to encode a $(5:4)$ polyrhythm. Make sure you select "Drum kit" as your instrument.
    \begin{hint} Use a $\timesig{5}{4}$ time signature.
    \end{hint}
    
\begin{instructorNotes} Answer:

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{polyrhythms/poly5-4.png}
\end{instructorNotes}
    
    \item Use the online sequencer to encode a $(3:5)$ polyrhythm. 

    \begin{instructorNotes} With the online sequencer, a key thing that students are likely to overlook is the fact that both rhythms need to end with a measure. Thus, part of the problem is finding a suitable time signature, a good grid, and how many measures to use.
    
    For this one, they basically need 15 little boxes, but  no choice of time signature and grid will give them that in exactly one measure. For example, if they do it on a 4/4 time signature with a grid of 1/4 they would have one extra rectangle which is going to set the rhythm off. 
    
    A time signature of 5/4 and a grid of 1 is most convenient. They would use 3 measures. They could also use a time signature of 5/4 and a 1/3 grid.

\begin{question}
Actually playing polyrhythms can be challenging! One technique used by musicians is to use a mnemonic phrase to help. The website below:
\begin{center}
\url{https://mymusiceducation.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/phrases-for-grouplets-polyrhythm/}
\end{center}
suggests that to play a  $(2:3)$-polyrhythm, you can use the phrase ``NOT DIFFICULT.'' We demonstrate the connection below.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{polyrhythms/oneline.png}
    
NOT \hspace{80 pt} DIF \hspace{30 pt} FI \hspace{30 pt} CULT
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sing your $(3:4)$ polyrhythm to the phrase "I can play this rhythm."
    \item Sing your $(6:4)$ polyrhythm to the phrase "Not difficult, not difficult."
    \item Sing your $(5:4)$ polyrhythm to the phrase "This rhythm difficult is not."
    \item Sing your $(3:5)$ polyrhythm to the phrase "Play this rhythm really fast."
\end{enumerate}

\end{question}


\begin{question}
Let's do some math. 
\begin{instructorNotes}
Parts a, b, and c want them to notice that you need to break a measure into $lcm(X,N)$ beats in order to create the polyrhythm.

Parts d and e are pointing at the fact that if X and N are not relatively prime, then the two rhythms will coincide at other points than just the start.
\end{instructorNotes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Using either the drum machine or the online sequencer, how many of the little rectangles do you need in a measure to be able to break it both in a 2-beat rhythm and a 3-beat rhythm? In other words, how many rectangles do you need to encode a $(3:2)$ polyrhythm?
    
    \answerspace
    
    \item More generally, how many of the little rectangles do you need in a measure (or several measures) to encode a $(X:N)$ polyrhythm?
    
    \answerspace
    
    \item Could you use less than that? Why or why not?
    \begin{hint}
    Look at the $(4:6)$ polyrhythm you encoded above.
    \end{hint}
    \answerspace
    
    \item Revisit the polyrhythms you encoded before. In which cases do the two drums only play at the same time at the beginning? In which cases do they sync at more places than just the beginning?
    
    \answerspace
    
    \item Imagine a $(4:8)$ polyrhythm (you can encode them if you feel like it!). When will a 4-beat rhythm and an 8-beat rhythm play at the same time?
    
    \answerspace
    
    \item What about a $(6:8)$ polyrhythm?
\end{enumerate}

Let's demonstrate by finding our $(2:3)$-polyrhythm above.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write $N=3$ beats on a staff:
