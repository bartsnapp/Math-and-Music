\begin{instructorNotes}
Play the following video from 0:50 until 5:50, then we'll work together through it in parts.

\end{instructorNotes}

Let's put together all we've learned about strings, waves, and sound by building our own single string instrument: a bottle guitar.  We'll be following the instructions laid out in this video:

\url{https://youtu.be/S8UT1iEj_p4?t=50} %start at 0:50

We'll be creating the instrument using two different strings, which means we'll need to make three knots, as referenced in the video.

We will provide you with the necessary materials: pipe, a 2-liter bottle, and two types of string.  

We have also already put a groove in the end of your pipe, so we'll begin in the video with simply placing the pipe in the 2-liter bottle, with the grooved side sticking out of the bottle.

%%\Section{Part 1: Groove in Pipe}
%%First, we'll want to rub a groove in the end of the pipe so that our string won't slip off the end.  To do this, we'll go outside and rub one end of the pipe on the concrete stairs outside of the math building.

\begin{question}
\textbf{Double Sheet Bend}

First, we will need to connect our two strings: the thinner one, and the thicker one, using the Double Sheet Bend knot.

Even though this is the third knot mentioned in the video, we will want to do this first in order to tie our thinner string and thicker string together before stringing the instrument.

\begin{instructorNotes}
Repeatedly play the portion of the video so students have a guide in tying the two strings together.

This knot is shown in the video at about the \link[5:10 time]{https://youtu.be/S8UT1iEj_p4?t=310}.
\end{instructorNotes}

This knot is shown in the video at about the \link[5:10 time]{https://youtu.be/S8UT1iEj_p4?t=310}.

You can also follow along with this resource, but note that since we're doing a \textbf{double} sheet bend, you will be wrapping the red rope around twice before looping it through:

\end{question}

\begin{question}
\textbf{Bowline Knot}

Take a piece of the thicker string and practice making the bowline knot several times.  You can watch the video repeatedly from the \link[2:00 time]{https://youtu.be/S8UT1iEj_p4?t=120} to use as a guide.  You can also use this helpful resource as well:

\url{https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot}

Once you feel comfortable making the bowline knot, wrap the thinner string around the bottom of the bottle, and tie a bowline knot in the string, placing it at about the half way point of the bottle.

\end{question}

\begin{question}
\textbf{Taut Line Hitch}

Again take a piece of the thicker string and practice making a taut line hitch.  

\begin{instructorNotes}
You can play the video repeatedly from the \link[2:55 time]{https://youtu.be/S8UT1iEj_p4?t=175} to use as a guide. 
\end{instructorNotes}
 
%You can also use this helpful resource:
%\url{https://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans-hitch-knot}

Once you feel comfortable making the taut line hitch, take the thicker string and wrap it around the bottom of the bottle and tie the taut line hitch to the same thicker portion of the string, on the opposite side of the bottle from the bowline knot.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
\textbf{Place Bottle Cap}
Now, we place the bottle cap under the bowline knot, between the bottle and the knot.  Make sure you pull your taut line hitch to make your string tight and secure!
\end{question}

Next, we'll tune our instrument!
