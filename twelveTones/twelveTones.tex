We can (almost!) tour the $12$ tones of music (ignoring octaves), by taking the frequency of the tone, and multiplying by 
\[
\frac{3^{12}}{2^n}
\]
In particular, if we do this, we had hoped to arrive at the original frequency at the end, so 
\[
\frac{3^{12}}{2^n} =1
\]
but this would mean
\[
3^{12} = 2^n
\]
which is impossible for a whole number $n$.


So here is a radical idea: Let's try to ``reinvent'' music, and see if we can resolve the issue above. As humans, we essentially made \textbf{one assumption} above, and that is that there are $12$ tones. 
\begin{quote}
Would the mathematics of music work out better if there were a different number of tones in music? 
\end{quote}
It is enough to find a fraction $\frac{n}{m}$ such that
\[
2^{n/m} = 3.
\]








\begin{question}
Through trial and error, your friend \textit{Mathemusical Mac} finds that 
\[
2^{1.58496250072115618145373894394}\approx 3
\]
Find three different fractions, 
\[
\frac{n}{m} \approx 1.58496250072115618145373894394
\]
where $m$ is less than $50$.

\end{question}



\begin{question}
   The idea,
   \begin{quote}
   that we want to approximate a real number with a fraction with a small denominator,
   \end{quote}
   arises in different contexts, and mathematicians have a method of finding such fractions. 
    Set:
\[
x_1 = 1.58496
\]
Write $x_1$ in terms of its whole-number part and its fractional part:
\[
x_1 = \mathbf{1} + (x_1-1)
\]
Now look at the reciprocal of $(x_1-1)$:
\begin{align*}
x_2 &=\frac{1}{x_1-1} \approx 1.70952\\
x_2 &= \mathbf{1} + (x_2-1)
\end{align*}
Continue on:
\begin{align*}
x_3 &=\frac{1}{x_2-1} \approx 1.4094\\
x_3 &= \mathbf{1} + (x_3-1)
\end{align*}
Again, again!
\begin{align*}
x_4 &=\frac{1}{x_3-1} \approx 2.4426\\
x_4 &= \mathbf{2} + (x_4-2)
\end{align*}
One last time:
\begin{align*}
x_5 &=\frac{1}{x_4-2} \approx 2.25938\dots\\
x_5 &= \mathbf{2} + (x_5-2)
\end{align*}
Whew, now I'm tired, we could continue on but I think it is time to
stop. Plugging back in, we find a crazy ``continued'' fraction:
\[
 1.58496\approx 1 + \dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{1}{1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}}
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplify the fraction:
\[
 1 + \dfrac{1}{1+\dfrac{1}{1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}}
\]

\item Find a ``continued fraction'' for $\sqrt{2}$.
\item Find a ``continued fraction'' for $\sqrt{3}$.
\item Find a ``continued fraction'' for $\pi$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
