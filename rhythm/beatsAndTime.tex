  We think of the ``speed'' of music.
\end{abstract}
\maketitle


Some pieces of music definitely ``sound'' faster than others. But what exactly does this mean? In what follows, we will learn how composers denote how fast a piece is played.



%For instructors only
%\begin{listOutcomes}
%\item Describe the  basic note and rest duration. 
%\item Explain that the ``speed'' of a piece of music is the interplay between tempo and time signature as well as the notes themselves. 
%\item Explain how the ``feel'' of a piece of music is influenced by the time signature.
%\item Encode basic rhythms into a drum machine.
%\item There's a relative relationship between note duration, and the value (in beats per minute) is determined by the time signature. 
%\end{listOutcomes}





\begin{question} Sit back, relax and \textit{listen} to the following pieces of music:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \link[Brahms, \textit{Hungarian Dance No. 10 Presto}]{https://youtu.be/BpWM3Dx_lGs}
    \item \link[Sarasate, \textit{Zapateado, Op. 23, No. 2}]{https://youtu.be/an3goB8KJkY}

The idea of using the rectangles is to remind students of fractions. Rectangles like these are a typical form they use to represent fractions. If they struggle to understand the diagram, as a hint, you can tell them to think about fractions.

\begin{question} %% understand it?
  The ``speed'' of music (slow or fast) is dependent on how many notes happen in a period of time. In this question, we will learn about the symbols that composers use to indicate that.
 
  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Here is a picture showing the symbols used for notes and the rhythmic relationship between them. Considering the top symbol represents a whole note, what duration do you think the other symbols represent?

    \item When a note is followed by a dot, its value increases by 50\%. In other words, the value of a dotted note is one and a half of the value it has without the dot. Write the corresponding fractions for the times of the following notes.

\item Cut the cards on the last pages and use them to compare sizes of notes. For every dotted note, find two or more notes that, when put together, add up to that dotted note.


For example: \quad\scalebox{2.5}{\musWholeDotted} \quad is the same as \quad \scalebox{2.5}{\musWhole} \scalebox{2.5}{\musHalf}\quad but also the same as \quad\scalebox{2.5}{\musHalf} \scalebox{2.5}{\musHalf} \scalebox{2.5}{\musHalf}

\begin{instructorNotes}
The card set mentioned below is basically a cut-out of the note sizes diagram above. The idea is that, by comparing the sizes of the cards, students can better understand the rhythmic relations between them.

\item So far we have seen notes that arise from \textit{halving notes}. However, notes can also be broken in thirds, a third of a note is called a \textbf{triplet}. To indicate triplets, we use the same symbols as before, but accompanied by brackets and the number $3$, as in the following diagram. Write the value of each note.

\begin{instructorNotes}Answer: $\frac{1}{6}$, $\frac{1}{12}$

The triplet fractions in (d) can be a little confusing since we are not seeing the rectangle divided in three equal parts. To help students understand this, you can emphasize that all equal notes have the same value. So, for example, in the third row we have the quarter triplets: each set of triplets makes $\sfrac{1}{2}$, but each set is made of 3 equal notes, so each note is $\sfrac{1}{3}$ of $\sfrac{1}{2}$, or $\sfrac{1}{6}$.
\end{instructorNotes}

    
\begin{question}
Music, like mathematics, has its own language and symbols. Musicians write music on a ruled rectangle with five lines, called staff. Staves for different kinds of instruments might have certain different characteristics. Here is an example for drums:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node at (0,0) {\mbox{
\instrumentnumber{1}           % number of instruments
\setstaffs1{1}                 % lines per instrument
%\generalmeter{\meterfrac{3}{4}}% time stamp. 
\generalsignature{0}          % sets the key. a number greater than 0 is sharp, smaller than 0 is flat
\setclefsymbol1\drumclef
\startextract

\bar
\Notes \qup h \cu h \cu h \cu h  \cu h \cu h \en
\bar
\Notes \qu h \hu h \cu h \cu h   \en
\bar
\Notes \qu h \qu h \hu h \en
\endextract}};
\draw[->] (-1,-1.3) -- (-3,-.5);
\draw[->] (0,-1.3) -- (1.5,-.5);
\draw[->] (1,-1.3) -- (4.8,-.5);
\node at (0,-1.5) {vertical lines};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We will learn more about writing music later on. For now and in this example, the notes of different heights simply represent different drums. 

When writing long passages of notes, musicians break them into \textbf{measures} or \textbf{bars} with vertical lines. Most of the time, and unless otherwise indicated, all the measures in a music piece are the same size: if we add up the fractions that correspond to the notes, every measure adds up to the same thing.


In the example above, the vertical lines (bar lines) divide the entire passage into four measures, and \textbf{in each measure the notes add to one whole note.} 

Now it's your turn.  Draw vertical lines on the following pieces of music to split them in measures so that each measure adds up to a whole note.
\begin{hint}
Use the note cards!
\end{hint}
\begin{instructorNotes}
Some students will be able to solve this problem without the cards. Encourage those who struggle to use the cards as aid. They need to put the cards one after the other, following the order on the staff, until they have enough to math the whole note rectangle. For example, the third measure in part (a) would be:

\begin{instructorNotes}

Some students might struggle to understand the next question at first, the idea of equivalent tempos. Part (b) is meant to serve as an easy example they can follow. If a student struggles, you can give them the answer, but explaining. 100 quarter notes is the same as 25 whole notes, so playing 100 quarter notes in a minute is the same tempo as playing 25 whole notes in a minute. You can even write this with fractions:
\[
100\frac{1}{4}=25
\]

With c and d, you can ask the questions "what does this equation mean?" and after that "in that case, how many quarter notes would be played in a minute?"

\end{instructorNotes}

\begin{question} However, remember what you know about fractions. The same fraction can represent different amounts depending on what the whole is. For example, \sfrac{1}{8} of a small pizza is definitely not the same as \sfrac{1}{8} of a big pizza. The same thing happens with music: a quarter note can be slower or faster depending on \textbf{tempo}.

Tempo is notated by writing a small equation like:
  \[
  \scalebox{2}{\quarternote} =100
  \]
  equating a note to a number that indicates how many of that note occur per minute. The example equation above indicates that the piece should be played fast enough to play $100$ quarter notes in exactly one minute.
\begin{enumerate}
      \item How many whole notes make $100$ quarter notes ($\scalebox{2}{\quarternote}$)?

\answerspace

      \item Tempo equations can use any type of note (meaning it doesn't have to be a quarter note). Write an equation that represents the same tempo as $\scalebox{2}{\quarternote} =100$ but using a whole note instead of a quarter note.
      \[
        \scalebox{2}{\musWhole} = \answerbox
      \]
     \item  Write an equation that represents the same tempo as $\scalebox{2}{\quarternote} =100$ but using an eighth note instead of a quarter note.
      \[
        \scalebox{2}{\musEighth} = \answerbox
      \]
      \item Suppose $\scalebox{2}{\halfnote}=60$.  Write the same tempo now as an equation with a quarter note.
      \[
        \scalebox{2}{\musQuarter} = \answerbox
      \]
      \item Suppose $\scalebox{2}{\musQuarterDotted}=80$.  Then:
      \[
        \scalebox{2}{\musQuarter} = \answerbox
      \]
 \end{enumerate} 
 \end{question}




\begin{question}
\textit{Mathemusical Mac} suggests that the following are all equivalent tempos:
\begin{align*}
\scalebox{2}{\musWhole} &= 30 \\
\scalebox{2}{\musHalfDotted} &= 45 \\
\scalebox{2}{\musHalf} &= 60\\
\scalebox{2}{\musQuarterDotted} &= 90\\
\scalebox{2}{\musQuarter} &= 120\\
\scalebox{2}{\musEighthDotted} &= 180\\
\scalebox{2}{\musEighth} &= 240
\end{align*}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Is \textit{Mathemusical Mac} correct? If not, fix his mistake. 

\answerspace
\answerspace

\item Write a function $y$ that depends on $x$ where $y$ is the number of notes that you need to play in a minute with a tempo of $\scalebox{2}{\musWhole} = 30$, and $x$ is the fraction that corresponds to the note. 

For example, since 30 whole notes ($\scalebox{2}{\musWhole}$) are the same as 60 half notes ($\scalebox{2}{\musHalf}$), then when we plug $x = \frac{1}{2}$, the function should give $y = 60$.
