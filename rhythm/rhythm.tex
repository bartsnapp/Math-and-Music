%\begin{listOutcomes}
%\item Describe the  basic note and rest duration. 
%\item Explain that the ``speed'' of a piece of music is the interplay between tempo and time signature as well as the notes themselves. 
%\item Explain how the ``feel'' of a piece of music is influenced by the time signature.
%\item Encode basic rhythms into a drum machine.
%\item There's a relative relationship between note duration, and the value (in beats per minute) is determined by the time signature.

\begin{instructorNotes}

%for instructors only
Explain that in the first few sessions we are going to get acquainted with music concepts. Ask the students that are already familiar with the music theory concepts to not reveal answers unless explicitly asked to do it. The first concept to review are rhythm and tempo, which is perhaps the most basic aspect of rhythm.

Play the following pieces, students should classify them as fast and slow. We have not defined this yet, but we are asking them to classify empirically. When we say that a piece is fast or slow, we are talking about tempo.

On the high school camp, students can work on their own.

%The following list should appear both on the high school handout and on the instructor's guide


%\begin{question} %% what is it?
%  Perhaps the most basic aspect of rhythm is tempo.
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Explain what ``tempo'' is in your own words, as you would like
%    it explained to you.
% \item Give an actual example of a piece with fast tempo.
% \item Give an actual example of a piece with slow tempo.
%  \end{enumerate}
%\end{question}
 
Ask the students to say what they think tempo refers to, based on comparing the two examples. Then ask the students who already know what tempo is, to explain to the class. Check for understanding.

\begin{question} %% understand it?
  The ``speed'' of music (slow or fast) is dependent on how many notes happen in a period of time. Here is a picture representing a rhythmic 
  relationship between some notes. Considering the top symbol represents a whole note, and the boxes around the notes are representative of the duration of the note, what duration do you think the other symbols represent? \textbf{Write the values of each note on the diagram.}

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{4}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c||c|}\hline

    \item When a note is followed by a dot, its value increases by 50\%. In other words, the value of a dotted note is $\sfrac{3}{2}$ of the value it has without the dot. Write the corresponding fractions for the times of the following notes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Bart thinks we can do the whole thing never mentioning rests.
%%
%\item Music also incorporates rests, times that we pass over in silence.	Just like we use different symbols to represent music notes of different duration, we also have special symbols for rests. Write the corresponding fractions of time for the rest symbols.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item So far we have seen notes that arise from halving time. However, time can also be broken in thirds. Look at the following chart that includes triplet notes. Note that triplet symbols are very similar to the other symbols we studied before, but they come in groups of three. The number 3 above the groups indicates these are triplet notes. Write the corresponding fraction for each note.
   \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{triplets.png}
  \end{center}

\end{enumerate}
\end{question}


\begin{instructorNotes}
 
%For instructor only
Explain that just like with fractions, a whole can represent a different thing and how much is $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{4}$ of it, depends on the whole. 

Moreover, even though equivalent fractions, such as $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{2}{4}$ might represent the same amount, in one case the whole is split only in two pieces, whereas on the other, the whole the pieces are smaller, since each whole is split into four.

You can use a cake or pizza analogy. A quarter slice might be the same as two eight slices, but in one case you have a single slice and in the other you have two smaller slices. 

With music is the same a whole note can be divided only in $2$ beats, or perhaps in $4$ or $8$. Students can think about beats as claps.
\end{instructorNotes}

%For students
\begin{question} Notes and rests are organized into small sections called
  \textbf{measures} or \textbf{bars}. Most of the time, and unless otherwise indicated, all the measures in a music piece have the same length.
  The \textbf{time signature} tell us how much music fits in a measure.
\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
  \node at (0,0) {\meterfrac{\raisebox{.2em}{M}}{W}};
  \node[anchor=west] at (1,1) {number of beats in a measure};
  \node[anchor=west] at (1,-1) {number of beats in a whole note};
  \draw[->] (1,.9) -- (.4,.4);
  \draw[->] (1,-.9) -- (.4,-.4);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
  For example in the passage below, the time signature is
  $\timesig{3}{4}$:
  
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{menuett34.png}
  \end{center}
  Since the time signature is $\timesig{3}{4}$, a whole-note is split into $4$ beats, but each measure only uses three beats. Hence, there are three quarter-notes, or equivalent, per measure.

Here are some examples of music in common time signatures. Listen to them carefully, trying to catch the time signature.
  \begin{itemize}
 \item $\timesig{4}{4}$
 \item $\timesig{3}{4}$
 \item $\timesig{6}{8}$
 \item $\timesig{5}{4}$
   \end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find another example of any of those time signatures.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{instructorNotes}
%For instructor
Explain how to use the drum machine. On the upper part, are the settings. To start, students should adjust the time signature to match the example. Ask them to not change the other parameters for now. 

The website shows a single measure. Each number corresponds to a beat. Each beat then is subdivided into rectangles to allow for shorter notes (eights or sixteenths, depending on the time signature).

Next, each height on the staff corresponds to a different drum. They can choose any drums they want, but all notes on the same line should be marked on the same drum.

Example solutions are shown for the four passages that students will encode on the drum machine.
\end{instructorNotes}

%For students
\begin{question}
  Here are four passages in four different time signatures. Encode them into a simple drum machine like this one:

\begin{question} Tempo is notated by writing a small equation like:
  \[
  \scalebox{2}{\quarternote} =100
  \]
  Equating a note to a number which indicated beats per minute. The example above means the pace of the piece is marked by playing 100 quarter notes per minute.
\begin{enumerate}
      \item With this tempo, how many whole notes should be played in a minute?
      %add line for answer

\item What would a tempo of $\scalebox{2}{\musQuarterDotted} = 80$ mean?
 %add line for answer
 
\item There are lots of equivalent tempos for various pieces of music. Think about why this might be and write down your thoughts.
 %add line for answer
 \end{enumerate} 
 \end{question}

    
\subsection{Music Notes and Fractions Practice} 
Remember that the time signature tells us how much each measure is worth. Most of the time, and unless otherwise indicated, all the measures in a music piece have the same length. 

 \begin{question}Draw vertical lines on the following pieces of music to split them in sections so that each section adds up to 1 whole note.

Example:

\includegraphics{example.png}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{split1.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{split2.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{split3.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{split4.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{split5.png}
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question} The pieces of music below are missing some notes. Work out what fraction is missing and add a single note or rest to make each measure add up to 1. (Notes placed at different levels on the score correspond to different sounds, but we won’t worry about that for the moment. For now, we will only care about time, so place the notes on any line you like.)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{addnotes1.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{addnotes2.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{addnotes3.png}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{addnotes4.png}
  %  \item \includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{addnotes5.png}
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

 Notice that in all the examples above, where each measure added up to 1, the time signature is \timesig{4}{4}, which means there are 4 beats per measure and also 4 beats in a whole note. Hence, each measure lasts a whole note.
 
\begin{question} The following examples no longer have a \timesig{4}{4} time signature. On each one of them, notice the time signature and draw notes to complete three more different measures. Remember that each measure should add up to the same time. (Note that here we are not using the full staff, but only one line. This is a simplification, so we can focus on the time signature rather than the height at which the notes are written, but music is not typically written in this manner.)

Remember what the time signature means:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
  \node at (0,0) {\meterfrac{\raisebox{.2em}{M}}{W}};
  \node[anchor=west] at (1,1) {number of beats in a measure};
  \node[anchor=west] at (1,-1) {number of beats in a whole note};
  \draw[->] (1,.9) -- (.4,.4);
  \draw[->] (1,-.9) -- (.4,-.4);
 \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{addnotes34}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{addnotes68}
    \item \includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{addnotes54}
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
